# ReactJS [CodeBridge]

>

## About

CodeBridge generated frontend React project.  
This project code uses [Sakai React](https://github.com/primefaces/sakai-react) application template built with [PrimeReact](https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/) components.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. We recommend node v16 and above.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/project
    npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test`. Test files are located relative to each component's `__test__` directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Modifying Styles

The main css styles file is located `src/assets/mainTheme/mainTheme.css`. You may change the theme colors as necessary.
